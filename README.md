Fruit Classification Model
This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying fruit images using a deep learning approach. The model is built using fastai, a high-level deep learning library built on top of PyTorch, and it leverages transfer learning to classify images of fruits accurately.

Features:
Fruit Classification: Classifies various types of fruits based on image inputs.
Streamlit Interface: A simple web interface powered by Streamlit that allows users to upload images and get real-time predictions.
Pre-trained Model: The model is trained on a dataset of fruit images and can predict the type of fruit in the image.
How to Use:
Install the Dependencies: To run this app locally, you will need to install the required dependencies. You can do so by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Streamlit App: Once the dependencies are installed, run the Streamlit app by executing the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Upload an Image: After the app is running, you can upload a fruit image (in formats like PNG, JPEG, etc.) and the model will predict the fruit type along with the prediction probability.

Model Details:
Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using transfer learning.
Framework: Built with fastai and PyTorch.
Training Data: The model is trained on a dataset of fruit images, which includes categories such as apples, bananas, oranges, etc.
Example:
Upload a fruit image (e.g., an apple).
The model will predict the fruit type (e.g., "Apple") along with the prediction confidence.
Technologies:
fastai: High-level deep learning library based on PyTorch.
Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web applications.
PyTorch: Deep learning framework used for model training.
